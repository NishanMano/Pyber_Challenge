# PyBer_Challenge


## Overview:

We used Maplotlib, Python, and Pandas to create an analysis for Pyber, which is a car ride-sharing company. We wanted to provide a better understanding for their CEO by showing them a visual aspect of all the data that they have collected. 

## Results:

### Summary 

We created a data frame which shows the type of cities with the amount of money earned through fares. It is quite easy to see that Urban population set brings in a lot more revenue.

1. One thing to note is that the Urban city overall had more drivers and rides. Even though there are more trips it is clear to see that the Urban drivers did not make as much money as their counterparts. I believe that this may be due to the distance traveled in trips while living in a rural area. 

2. If a driver worked primarily in a rural area in comparison to a sub-urban area they would make significantly more money. Once again with the distance travelled it would make it worth while for the driver. 




## Recommendations:

1. I do believe for the Urban drivers it would be hard to keep this as a permanent job. In terms of money in the long run it will be very hard to sustain. They should suggest finding some work in the rural areas if possible as this would be more worthwhile. I think that Pyber should invest in marketing in more compact urban areas to get more attention for their company. They may look to create new incentives for their urban drivers to keep them on board.   


2. I would recommend researching the distance traveled as this can provide more data to research on. Using this we could make more tables and show other measures such as average miles driven in each section. With this knowledge, we are able to create more meaningful graphs and diagrams to better understand how Pyber can become more successful.
